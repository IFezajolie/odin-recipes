    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delicious homemade pizza with your favorite toppings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups warm water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Assorted toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let it sit for 5 minutes, or until the mixture becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and divide it into two portions. Roll out each portion into a round pizza crust on a floured surface.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pizza crusts to a baking sheet or preheated pizza stone.</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the crusts and top with shredded mozzarella cheese and your favorite toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the crust is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, let the pizzas cool for a few minutes, and then slice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
