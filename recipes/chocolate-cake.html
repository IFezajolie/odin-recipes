        <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix well until combined.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour in the boiling water while stirring the batter. The batter will be thin, but that's normal.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Once the cakes are completely cooled, you can frost them with your favorite frosting or serve them as is.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate cake!</li>
